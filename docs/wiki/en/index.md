# Narrator Master - Wiki

Welcome to the **Narrator Master** documentation, the AI assistant for Dungeon Masters in Foundry VTT.

## What is Narrator Master?

Narrator Master is a Foundry VTT module that helps you run tabletop RPG sessions more smoothly and effectively. Using OpenAI's artificial intelligence, the module:

- **Listens and transcribes** session audio in real-time
- **Identifies speakers** distinguishing between players and game master
- **Analyzes the Journal** of the adventure to understand context
- **Generates suggestions** on what to say or do based on the conversation
- **Detects deviations** from the planned plot
- **Creates infographic images** on request

## Who is it For?

Narrator Master is an exclusive tool for the **Dungeon Master** (Game Master). Players will not see the panel nor will they be able to access the module's features.

It is particularly useful for:

- Beginner DMs who want support during sessions
- Experienced DMs who want to keep track of conversations
- Complex sessions with many details to remember
- Written adventures that require fidelity to the plot
